# Car Price Prediction — README

![Car image](/car_price.jpg)

## Introduction
This repository contains a project to predict used car prices using machine learning. The goal is to build a robust, reproducible pipeline that ingests car listing data, performs exploratory data analysis and preprocessing, engineers features, trains several candidate models, selects the best model, and exports artifacts for evaluation and deployment.

## Problem definition
Predict the market price of a used car given attributes such as make, model, year, mileage, engine size, fuel type, transmission, and location. The task is a supervised regression problem: input = car features, output = continuous price value.

## Objective
- Produce an accurate and generalizable price prediction model.
- Provide a reproducible training pipeline and simple evaluation reports.
- Export a production-ready model artifact and basic instructions for deployment.

## Challenges
- Data quality: missing values, inconsistent formatting, outliers.
- Feature heterogeneity: categorical variables with high cardinality (models, trims).
- Temporal bias: price trends change over time.
- Geographic variance: price differences across regions.
- Imbalanced records for rare makes/models.

## Data source
- The dataset was provided by Data Science Nigeria in the 2025 ML Hackathon.

## Reproducibility & setup
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
     - python -m venv .venv
     - source .venv/bin/activate  (or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
2. Install dependencies:
     - pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Place raw dataset at data/raw/used_cars.csv or update ingestion path in src/data.py.

## Data preparation
- Steps applied:
    - Load raw CSV.
    - Standardize column names and types.
    - Handle missing values (impute or drop based on column importance).
    - Remove duplicates and obvious errors (e.g., year in future, negative mileage).
    - Filter unrealistic prices and outliers using domain thresholds or IQR method.
    - Save cleaned splits to data/processed/ (train.csv, val.csv, test.csv).

## Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Typical EDA tasks:
    - Summary statistics for numerical features.
    - Distribution plots for price and mileage.
    - Correlation matrix for numeric predictors.
    - Categorical frequency tables for make/model/fuel/transmission.
    - Price trends by year and location.
- Save visualizations in reports/figures/.

## Feature engineering
- Numeric features: year -> age, mileage scaling, interaction terms as needed.
- Categorical features: target encoding or frequency encoding for high-cardinality features; one-hot for small-cardinality.
- Feature selection: remove low-importance or highly collinear features.

## Modeling approach
- Evaluate several regressors:
    - Tree-based models (RandomForest, XGBoost, LightGBM)
    - Gradient boosting ensembles
- Use cross-validation and hyperparameter search (GridSearchCV or Optuna).
- Early focus on baseline simple model, then iterate with more complex models.

## Training
- Training script: src/train.py
- Expected behavior:
    - Load processed train/val sets.
    - Fit preprocessing pipeline (imputer, scaler, encoders).
    - Train model with CV / hyperparameter tuning.
    - Save best model and preprocessing artifacts to models/.

Example (replace with actual commands):
- python src/train.py --config configs/train.yaml

## Evaluation & metrics
- Primary metrics:
    - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Produce evaluation on a held-out test set and a calibration residual plot.
- Save metrics and model explanation artifacts (feature importance, SHAP plots) to reports/.
